- 👋 Hi, I’m Enrique (@princeKike27)
- 👀 I'm a Data Analyst and a Python enthusiast. My expertise is in Data Analytics and Data Science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently doing a MSc in Applied Statistics and Data Science
- 💞️ Data, Technology, Sports Analytics and Philosophy are my passions. My name is Enrique Barón Gómez 
     and I've been working in the data analysis field doing predictive analytics and business intelligence for the past 6 
     years in dynamic and fast-growing Startups. I’ve helped the companies I’ve worked with boost their productivity by 
     creating machine learning models, that allow them to take decisions based on the patterns and structure of their historical data 
     
     We are at the verge of a new technological revolution where every interaction that we have in society is recorded and 
     stored as data, its up to us now how we use it…
