- 👋 Hi, I’m Enrique (@princeKike27)
- 👀 I'm a Data Analyst and a Python enthusiast. My expertise is in Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science
- 💞️ Data, Technology, Sports Analytics and Philosophy are my passions. My name is Enrique Barón Gómez 
     and I have been working in the data analysis field doing sales analytics and Business Intelligence for the past 4 years. 
     I’ve held data analyst and BI positions in dynamic and fast growing startups. I transitioned into analytics from a business 
     background and even though, I was somewhat lost at the beginning of this journey; there has been an awesome community 
     of online courses, teachers and students that helped me to learn about this field, so Thanks Guys! 
     
     We are at the verge of a new technological revolution where every interaction that we have in society is recorded and 
     stored as data, its up to us now how we use it…
